# Regularized Linear Regression : US House Price Prediction
> The US housing company, Surprise Housing wants to enter the Australian market and wants to know the important predictors in getting the actual price of properties. This project will typically aim to build a model which will look into different parameters which strongly correlates with the price of a house.
> With this, the company can try to purchase a house at a lower price and sell it at a higher price to generate more profits.
> The project covers detailed comparison of simple linear regression model (using RFE) with regularised regression using ridge(L2) and lasso(L1). 

## Technologies Used
- Python3 as a programming language tool
- Python libraries to visualise the data and perform linear modeling  

## Files
- Zip file containing jupyter notebook and a pdf file
- Jupyter notebook containing the detailed analysis, linear regression model and regularized model using ridge and lasso
- PDF containing solutions to subjective questions
